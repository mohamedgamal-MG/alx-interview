# Minimum Operations

## Overview

This Python script calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in a text file. The two allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste."

## Project Structure

- `0-minoperations.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the `minOperations` function.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `minOperations` function.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project and usage instructions.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Implementation Details

The `minOperations` function uses a greedy algorithm to find the prime factorization of the given number `n`. It iterates through the divisors and adds them to the total number of operations needed to reach `n`.
